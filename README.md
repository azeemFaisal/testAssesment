# testAssesment

  - Installation steps
  --> You can clone this repository into your local machine and publish the code if you don't want to use the existing .exe file which is there in the repository.
  - How to run your code / tests
--> Run the console app Porject directly with the proper file path. You can give input to the project from debug properties and the code will get executed locally.
  - Where to find your code
--> You can find my code in Program.cs file. Whole logic is done within the same file. 
  - Was it your first time writing a unit test, using a particular framework, etc?
--> Yes , it is my first time where I have processed some files into a console application and published it for use.
    And I was not able to write test cases due to time constratint also as I have not written test cases before.
  - What would you have done differently if you had had more time
--> If I had some more time and some guidance, I can definetly write more generic code and in much better way so that it can be scalable and maintainable.
    I have still tried to handle the exceptions and provided the desired output from accessing the files.
